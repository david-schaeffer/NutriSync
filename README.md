# NutriSync

NutriSync is an app designed to help busy students manage their nutrition and stress through intuitive meal and mood logging. 
Rather than focusing on grams or calories, NutriSync aims to help users understand the intersection of nutrition and well-being from a holistic perspective.
Using personalized insights, educational articles, and log history, NutriSync enables users to make informed decisions about their nutrition and well-being.
